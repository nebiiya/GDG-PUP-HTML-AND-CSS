    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Neriah, an 18-year-old BSCS freshman from PUP Main. I am currently learning web development 
        and trying to delve into the different opportunities our organization has to offer. I joined GDG to 
        hone and upgrade my foundational knowledge and skills in web development and to try to connect more with 
        like-minded individuals in our community. I am looking forward to learning and having fun on this journey 
        with everyone!</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>My current hobbies are playing the ukulele, reading books, journaling, and watching films, my favorite genres today 
        are horror and mystery. I also play games when not busy, mostly chill games like Stardew Valley and Terraria. When 
        there is more free time, I would love to get back on learning graphic design, drawing, and start painting. </p>
